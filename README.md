## 🚀Introduction

A fashion recommendation system that utilizes the power of transfer learning using ResNet-50 architecture along with Annoy an optimized K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to deliver personalized recommendations based on user input. By performing feature extraction on a large dataset of over 45,000 images using transfer learning with ResNet-50, I was able to effectively analyze the image data. To identify the top 5 closest matches to a user's input, I implemented a similarity search approach using K-Nearest Neighbours, providing personalized fashion recommendations. The system is user-friendly and intuitive, and allows for accurate and effective analysis of image data.

This  recommendation system showcases the versatility and power of  transfer learning, similarity search, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), providing a solid foundation for building larger and more comprehensive recommendation systems

##   💻Recommendation Engine:Proposed Methodology 

In this project, we propose a model that uses Convolutional Neural Network and the Nearest 
neighbour backed recommender. As shown in the figure Initially, the neural networks are trained and then 
an inventory is selected for generating recommendations and a database is created for the items in 
inventory. The nearest neighbour’s algorithm is used to find the most relevant products based on the 
input image and recommendations are generated.

## 📊Application Flow-Chart


To generate recommendations, our proposed approach uses Sklearn Nearest neighbours . This allows us to find the nearest neighbours for the 
given input image. The similarity measure used in this Project is the Cosine Similarity measure. The top 5 
recommendations are extracted from the database and their images are displayed.

## Convolutional Neural Networks

- Convolutional Neural Network is a specialized neural network designed for visual data, such as images & videos. But CNNs also work well for non-image data (especially in NLP & text classification).
- Its concept is similar to that of a vanilla neural network (multilayer perceptron) – It follows the same general principle of forwarding & backward propagation.
  
- Once the data is pre-processed, the neural networks are trained, utilizing transfer learning 
  from ResNet50. More additional layers are added in the last layers that replace the architecture and 
  weights from ResNet50 in order to fine-tune the network model to serve the current issue. The figure
  shows the ResNet50 architecture.

## Getting the inventory

The images from Kaggle Fashion Product Images Dataset. The 
inventory is then run through the neural networks to classify and generate embeddings and the output 
is then used to generate recommendations. 

### The Figure shows a sample set of inventory data

## Experiment and results

The concept of Transfer learning is used to overcome the issues of the small size Fashion dataset. 
Therefore we pre-train the classification models on the DeepFashion dataset that consists of 44,441
garment images. The networks are trained and validated on the dataset taken. The training results 
show a great accuracy of the model with low error, loss and good f-score.

## ✨Conclusion

In this project, we have presented a novel framework for fashion recommendation that is driven by data, 
visually related and simple effective recommendation systems for generating fashion product images. 
The proposed approach uses a two-stage phase. Initially, our proposed approach extracts the features 
of the image using CNN classifier ie., for instance allowing the customers to upload any random 
fashion image from any E-commerce website and later generating similar images to the uploaded image 
based on the features and texture of the input image. It is imperative that such research goes forward 
to facilitate greater recommendation accuracy and improve the overall experience of fashion 
exploration for direct and indirect consumers alike.
